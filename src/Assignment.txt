The Assignment

Your task is to create a dynamic form generator application using React.js. The application
should allow users to create custom forms with various types of form fields, such as text inputs,
dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

Key Requirements:
● Users should be able to add and remove form fields dynamically.
● Each form field should have a label and a corresponding component based on the field
type.
● Users should be able to specify the type of each form field. Fields to be supported: text
input, text area, dropdown, checkbox, radio button.
● For dropdown fields, users should be able to define a set of options to choose from.
● The application should support form submission and validation, displaying error
messages for invalid fields.
● Users should be able to save and load form configurations as JSON data. (Here the form
fields configuration needs to be saved as JSON)

Additional Challenges (optional):
● Users should be able to set validation rules for form fields, including required fields,
minimum/maximum length, and specific formats (e.g., email, phone number).
● Implement conditional logic for form fields, where the visibility of certain fields depends
on the value of other fields.
Example for this is:
- The HSC/Diploma/UG/PG marks input should be shown only if the user has selected
the respective qualification.
- If the user is a government servant then ask for government id as proof.
● Add support for file upload fields, including validation for file type and size.
